## Introduction ##
Hello! Welcome to my personal blog where I will share little bits of things that I have picked up or learned and maybe a few opinions.  You should subscribe to the [feed](/atom.xml) or you can always reach me on one of the social media sites on the sidebar.

## A Little About Me ##
I am an experienced Devops Engineer with strong skills in virtualization, software engineering, operations and troubleshooting.  I have successfully maintained and managed very large scale virtualized environments.  A proven leader on several projects and software design.
