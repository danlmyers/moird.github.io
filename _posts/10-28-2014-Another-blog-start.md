title: Another Blog Start
---
So making a new start of a blog.  Maybe I will write more than a post or two every year.  The key thing here is moving to a new platform.  After trying to use wordpress for a long time I have found that I really dislike it.  Wordpress is very bulky php application that for a single person blog or even a two person blog just seemed overkill and difficult to manage.  For running a site with different blogs and lots of writers it probably works fine.

Left with the choice of what blog to move to away from wordpress I thought a lot about overall usage of the blog and which would work best for me.  I ended up with just hosting it on github using jekyll and static pages.  Seems like the best way to go, I can point my domain name here to make it nice and if anyone wants to see the site code it is available on the [project page](https://github.com/moird/moird.github.io).  Plus Markdown is reasonable to write in and this has enough features to suite me at a price tag that works well.
